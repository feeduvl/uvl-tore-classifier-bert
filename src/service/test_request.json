It helps  more than, say Google maps as it can show a route away from roads for walking or hiking. You can track you own routes with photos so others can see what you have don, and you can track your own progress as you try new routes or activities. \nIt is useful being able to plan a route on your desktop/laptop with a bigger screen, and then transfer to to your phone to use when you are actually out...though it does rely on having a good internet signal, which in remote areas is not always possible.",

It can consider what roads you would like to use e.g. quieter roads if commuting by bicycle and footpaths etc.\nYou can then save these routes and gives you further information, with elevation, distance and likely time to take given.\nIf you are looking for a local walk or bicycle route, you can also view popular routes planned and used by other users of the app. These are grouped by beginner, intermediate and advanced routes.\nThe application also allows you to add pictures so that you can see popular landmarks on the route, and get some idea of location.",
